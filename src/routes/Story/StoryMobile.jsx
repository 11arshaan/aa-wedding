          In the early summer of 2020, Arsheen’s friend sent her a video. It was
          in that video that Amaritpal was featured for a brief moment. Despite
          not being the type to follow people first or find attraction towards
          someone via social media, Arsheen decided to take a peek at his
          Instagram. Initially she debated whether or not to follow him.
          Strangely enough, Arsheen was hesitant because she knew if she
          followed him, something would certainly happen between them.

          She ended up following him and sure enough, Amaritpal messaged her and
          quickly made his interest in her known.

          The pair began to talk and FaceTime daily, growing close over their
          shared interests and passions. Amaritpal would stay up late, despite
          working as a night shift manager at the time, just to talk with his
          “baby jaan.” With Amaritpal being based in Toronto and Arsheen in
          Atlanta, they knew long distance would be the only option. But, when
          you know…you know. And both of them knew that they had found their
          person. On January 1st of 2021, Amaritpal asked Arsheen to officially
          be his girlfriend and she said yes. Despite being long distance, their
          love has known no bounds. Years later, Amaritpal celebrates this as
          one of the best decisions in his life and they are still in their
          “honeymoon phase.” If you know the pair, you know that phase will
          never end for them. From strangers, to best friends, to lovers and
          soul mates… their love is the kind of love that inspires people. Their
          love is as magical as they, as individuals, are.
