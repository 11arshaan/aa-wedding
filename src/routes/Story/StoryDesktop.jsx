          In the early summer of 2020, Arsheen’s friend sent her a video. In
          that video, Amaritpal was featured for a brief moment. Despite not
          being the type to follow people first or find attraction towards
          someone on the internet, Arsheen checked his page out. She debated
          whether or not to follow him and was hesitant because she knew if she
          followed him, something would happen between them. 
          <br />
    
          At the time she was
          solely focused on school and work.

          She ended up following him and sure enough, Amaritpal messaged her and
          made his interest in her known.

          The pair began to talk daily, growing close over their shared interests
          and passions. With Amaritpal being based in Toronto and Arsheen in
          Atlanta, they knew long distance would be the only option. But, when
          you know…you know. And the both of them knew that they had found their
          person. On January 1st of 2021, Amaritpal asked Arsheen to officially
          be his girlfriend and she said yes. Despite being long distance, their
          love has known no bounds. Years later, they are still in their
          “honeymoon phase” and if you know the pair, you know that phase will
          never end for them. From strangers, to best friends, to lovers and
          soul mates. Amaritpal and Arsheen’s love is the kind of love that
          inspires people. It is the kind of love that poets write about and
          stories are written about.
